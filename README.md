# Factors-Affecting-Life-Expectancy
A project on statistical analysis of factors affecting Life expectancy in a country

### This project provides a statistical approach towards determining the factors that contribute towards a person's life expectancy.
Dataset taken from kaggle, is composed of the following features:
Country', 'Year', 'Status', 'Life expectancy ', 'Adult Mortality','infant deaths', 'Alcohol', 'percentage expenditure', 'Hepatitis B','Measles ', ' BMI ', 'under-five deaths ', 'Polio', 'Total expenditure','Diphtheria ', ' HIV/AIDS', 'GDP', 'Population',' thinness  1-19 years', ' thinness 5-9 years','Income composition of resources', 'Schooling'

### A two samples t-test for numerical variables and a chi-square test is used to validate the Null Hypothesis for features in the data.
### Finally, three different regression models : Linear Regression, Lasso Regression and Decision Tree Regressor are used to verify the verdict passed by the statistical tests. 
### After testing the models using R-square regression metric, it is found that the Decision Tree Regressor is relatively more accurate than the other two regression models.

## How to Run:
1. Open Jupyter Notebook
2. Install the necessary libraries.
3. Execute each cell sequentially.
